# ðŸ§  Alzheimer MRI Classifier

A deep learningâ€“powered web application to classify stages of dementia from brain MRI scans using two AI models: a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.

This project was built with **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**, making it easy to run locally or deploy to the cloud.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload an MRI brain scan and get classification results instantly
- Select between CNN and ANN models for prediction
- Confidence score for prediction
- Clean and interactive web UI with Streamlit
- Easily extendable with your own models and classes

---

## ðŸ§© Models

Two pre-trained models are included:

1. **CNN Model** (`cnn_mri_model.keras`) â€” handles image-based input directly.
2. **ANN Model** (`ann_mri_model.keras`) â€” handles either flattened image vectors or image-like tensors depending on training setup.

> ðŸ’¡ Both models are expected to output 4 classes:
>
> - Mild Demented
> - Moderate Demented
> - Non Demented
> - Very Mild Demented
